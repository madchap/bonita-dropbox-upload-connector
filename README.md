bonita-dropbox-upload-connector
===============================

Single and Multiple file Dropboy upload implementation. It uses dropbox-code 1.7.6 and oauth2 tokens. The generation of the token is not covered here, only the upload.

Created on Bonita Performance 6.2.6, but should work on all versions.

Code modified to fit general purposes. Please try and let me know if it works for you.

Best,
fred
