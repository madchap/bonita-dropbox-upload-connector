bonita-dropbox-upload-connector
===============================

Single and Multiple file Dropboy upload implementation. It uses dropbox-code 1.7.6 and oauth2 tokens. The generation of the token is not covered here, only the upload.

Created on Bonita Performance 6.2.6, will currently not work on Community Edition as it was exported from a Subscription Studio. Contribution welcome to make a Community Ed. compatible version. I may do it if time provides, but no promise.

Code modified to fit general purposes. Please try and let me know if it works for you.

Best,
fred
